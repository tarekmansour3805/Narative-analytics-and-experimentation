setting the stage:
two identical datasets that have the same coulmns only one difference, the first dataset is intended to focus on the years of flying around the period
from 1950 to 1980 while the other dataset is focused more on the later years of flying from 1980 to 2009.
the tests that will be initiated will focus on the improvement of flying tochnologies over the two datasets, as it will show the number of incidents that
have happened over the period from 1950 to 1980 contained by the number of fatalities. in order to insure proper scailing of the datasets the has to be a
factor involved, it contains the complete understanding of the number of incidents over the years dependent on the weather conditions. as this test
will show the improvment of aviation technology facing natural incendents.


Rollout Plan:
get all the data plots based on the principal of 3 columns only Fatalities, year and month. those three columns will be enough to get the intended data.
as it cuts both data sets by year and group the fatalities by month.


Success metric:
use p and t value to conclude that both datasets are far apart in the number of fatalities per year.

secondary metric:
setting the cloud for the cumber of fatalities over the years.

numbers of further information are posted on the notbook sheet.
